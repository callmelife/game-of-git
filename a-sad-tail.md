House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

I would like for Ned Stark to invite electricity.
He will then challenge Ben Franklin for world domination.
Everyone is saved.
